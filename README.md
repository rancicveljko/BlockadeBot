# Blockade Bot
This is an academic project meant for learning about artificial intelligence. 
The goal of the project was to make a playable game of blockade and be able to verse the computer.
This project was meant to give my team practical experience with concepts like decision trees and algorithms like Minimax, as well as working in a new language that is Python.
